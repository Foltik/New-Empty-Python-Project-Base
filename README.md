# [New Empty Python Project Base](https://github.com/Neuraxio/New-Empty-Python-Project-Base)

> This is just what you need to start a new Python project.

Simply use this project template to start new python projects.

## Usage

1. Rename the `project/` folder and all references to this folder to customize your project name.
2. You can run tests by running `pytest` in the root, or by running `python3 setup.py test`. Code coverage is enabled by default.
3. Edit the `setup.py` of your project to make it truly yours. 
4. Start coding in your now-renamed project folder and add tests under the `testing/` folder!
5. [Upload](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) your project as a package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), the Python Package Index!
